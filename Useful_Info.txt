Scikit-Learn is very easy to use, yet it implements many machine learning 
algorithms efficiently, so it makes for a great entry point to learning 
machine learning. It was created by David Cournapeau in 2007, and is now 
led by a team of researchers at the French Institute for Research in Computer 
Science and Automation (Inria).

TensorFlow is a more complex library for distributed numerical computation. 
It makes it possible to train and run very large neural networks efficiently 
by distributing the computations across potentially hundreds of multi-GPU 
(graphics processing unit) servers. TensorFlow (TF) was created at Google and 
supports many of its large-scale machine learning applications. It was open 
sourced in November 2015, and version 2.0 was released in September 2019.

Keras is a high-level deep learning API that makes it very simple to train and 
run neural networks. Keras comes bundled with TensorFlow, and it relies on 
TensorFlow for all the intensive computations.


Machine learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.

Here is a slightly more general definition:

    [Machine learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without 
    being explicitly programmed.

    Arthur Samuel, 1959

And a more engineering-oriented one:

    A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and 
    some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with 
    experience E.

    Tom Mitchell, 1997
